<p>Graphite and etsy&#39;s version of statsd are both excellent pieces of software, 
with active and vibrant communities. They&#39;re well maintained, well architected, 
and widely used.</p>

<p>So why did we make batsd (and the three distinct predecessor versions)? 
There are a few reasons:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Lingua Franca</strong>. 37signals (not surprisingly) primarily uses Ruby. 
Our apps are written in Ruby, the configuration management system we use 
has a Ruby DSL, and we collectively have over a hundred years worth of 
experience in Ruby. We&#39;ve done a small amount with Node.js as an 
organization (which Etsy&#39;s version of statsd is written in), but 
nothing really with Python or Django (which graphite is written in).<br>
Both are great languages, but we&#39;re comparative novices in those 
languages.  We used etsy&#39;s statsd and graphite briefly, and found 
ourselves in a whole world of new dependencies, Chef cookbooks, 
and ways of running apps.</p>

<p>We want to be comfortable with our tools and be able to read, understand, 
and modify the source of those tools so that they aren&#39;t black box 
dependencies. We could learn, but it&#39;s not what we know. </p>

<p>2) <strong>We weren&#39;t going to use graphite&#39;s UI much</strong>. One of the great things 
about Graphite is it&#39;s interface, but we knew from the start we weren&#39;t 
going to end up using it much. We have upwards of a dozen distinct data 
repositories (statsd, MySQL, third party APIs, etc. ), and we knew we 
wanted to be able to compare and analyze them in a common UI anyway. </p>

<p>We developed our own tool called &quot;Flyash&quot; (a play on &quot;Graphite&quot;) to 
accomplish this that&#39;s similar in many ways to Graphite (we&#39;ll release this 
eventually),  so we weren&#39;t going to benefit from one of the best parts 
of Graphite anyway.</p>

<p>3) <strong>It looked like it would be easy</strong>. Looks can be deceiving. In all 
seriousness, it&#39;s been a great learning experience and a lot of fun building it.</p>
